Our research group applies machine learning methods to several topics in astrophysics, such as:

* Equivariant convolutional neural networks for investigating galaxy clusters
* Diffusion models for conditional generation of galaxy images
* Graph neural networks representing large scale structure
* Exploiting machine learning for maximizing science with wide-area imaging surveys 
* Best practices and ethics for astronomical and scientific machine learning
* Strategic use of artificial intelligence to improve research astronomy
